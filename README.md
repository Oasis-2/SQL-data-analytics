# sql-data-analytics-project
A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more.
This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.

# SQL Data Exploration Project

This project contains a sequence of structured SQL scripts that progressively explore and analyze a relational database. It is intended for educational or analytical purposes and follows a modular structure that builds in complexity over time.
